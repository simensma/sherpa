This folder contains styles for *third party* libraries (not custom libraries, which one might assume).

Some of these libraries require custom styling for implementation, and some we just want to customize for our usage.

They are not organized within admin/public folders but included ad-hoc; see the root admin.less and public.less files
to see which styles are included where.
