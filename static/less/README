Description of the files in this directory:
-------------------------------------------

compile.sh
  Compilation script used on the production server (with a git post-hook) to compile less into css

admin.less  A compilation of all less files to be included in a single css for the admin layout

public.less
  A compilation of all less files to be included in a single css for the public layout

editor.less
  Ad-hoc compilation for editor css, since it is common for admin and public. Currently a separately included css file;
  needs to be refactored into admin.less and public.less though - this is a hack.

print.less
  Style overrides to be applied for media="print", both in the admin and public layout

500.less
  Styles for the 500 Server Error page

ie7.less
  Separate styles for Internet Explorer 7. Now deprecated as we're not supporting IE7 anymore, at least not for the
  admin layout. We might want to keep it a little while for the public layout, but it can probably be removed soon.
