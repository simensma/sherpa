    Soo, it seems the focus.models.Enrollment.email field is of the 'ntext' type, which is completely wrong.
    We can't perform lookups on it without casting it to nvarchar, so we'll have to do this with a raw query.
    Yes, this is truly truly horrible. However, at least Django still takes care of SQL injection, so as long
    as the query is correct, this *should* be all right. The current query would look like this with ORM:
    Enrollment.get_active().filter(email=email)
    """
    from focus.models import Enrollment
    query = 'select * from %s where (("Paymethod" = %s or "Paymethod" = %s ) and "SubmittedDt" is null and Cast(Email as nvarchar(max)) = %s )' % (Enrollment._meta.db_table, '%s', '%s', '%s')
